### To Whoever may read this:

This is a public use repository that I will add from my own experiences dealing primarily with scripting in IBM Maximo.

Feel free to take  a look and tweak what is here for your own projects.

I hope to grow this and make it a good source of more niche automation script options.

Thanks!
